                    <h3>Here are some important information about Ariel Camus.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ariel Camus was born in Mendoza, Argentina

                        left the country when an economic crisis occurred in 2001. For this reason, Camusâ€™s family
                        decided to move to Spain, where he lived in the Canary Islands

                        after 4 years he moved to Madrid to study telecommunications engineering

                        His first startup was TouristEye which was later sold to Lonely Planet, an Australian company
                        focused on travel books

                        He worked as a teacher at a school in Burundi

                        The Senior Product Manager of Lonely Planet discussed with him how difficult it was to find
                        talent for the company, this was the spark that marked the beginning of his next startup:
                        Microverse
